The other options, such as an airplane or movie, do not typically involve curtains being drawn back in the same way. An auditorium could be a more general term that includes a theatre but is not as specific. A show is a broad term that could apply to many contexts, including a theatre.

This disease affects the brain and nervous system, leading to severe symptoms and ultimately death. Mad cow disease is a prion disease, which means it is caused by misfolded proteins that can lead to progressive neurological damage. \n\nNote: While getting full (B) and feeling full (E) are common experiences when eating a hamburger, they are not causes of death.
