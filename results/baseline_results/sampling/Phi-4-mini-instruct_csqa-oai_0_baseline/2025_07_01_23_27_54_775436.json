The potential hazard concern could be valid here.\n\nC: concert hall - Similar to a theater, a concert hall might have mezzanines for seating, and people of different ages would be attending concerts. The potential hazard concern could also be valid here.\n\nD: floors - This option seems less relevant because it refers to the general structure rather than a specific type of building where mezzanines are commonly found.\n\nE: school - Schools often have mezzanines, especially in older buildings, and they house children, teenagers, and adults (teachers, staff, and parents).

The last word of a book is not a standard section or feature. IKEA instructions would not typically be found in a book unless it is a book specifically about IKEA products. An afterword and an epilogue are both sections that can appear at the end of a book, but they serve different purposes. An afterword is often a reflective piece written by the author, while an epilogue is a narrative section that provides closure or additional information about the story or subject matter. In this case, both the conclusion and the epilogue are likely to be found in a book, but they are not the same. The conclusion is a summary of the main points or arguments presented in the book, while the epilogue is a separate section that provides additional information or commentary. Therefore, the most likely answers are B: conclusion, C: ikea instructions, D: afterword, and E: epilogue. However, the question asks for what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword, so the answer would be B: conclusion, C: ikea instructions, D: afterword, and E: epilogue, excluding the foreword.<|end|>\nSo the correct choice is B: conclusion, C: ikea instructions, D",
