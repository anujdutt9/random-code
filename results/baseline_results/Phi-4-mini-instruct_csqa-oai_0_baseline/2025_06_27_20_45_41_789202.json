If a person consumes beef contaminated with BSE, they can contract variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a rare and fatal condition. This can lead to severe neurological symptoms and ultimately death. While feeling full (B) and getting full (D) are common experiences when eating, they do not cause death. Gas (A) is not typically associated with eating hamburgers and does not lead to death. Death (D) is a possible outcome but is not directly caused by eating a hamburger unless it is contaminated with BSE.<|end|>\nSo the correct choice is C: Mad cow disease.<|end|>",
