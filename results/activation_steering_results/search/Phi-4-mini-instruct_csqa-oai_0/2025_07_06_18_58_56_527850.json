While some wild birds may also be found in deserts, the countryside is a more common and diverse habitat for a wide variety of wild bird species. Wild birds do not typically live in cages, the sky, or on windowsills, as these are not natural habitats for them. The sky is where birds fly, but it is not a place where they live. A cage is a man-made enclosure used to confine birds, and a windowsill is a place where birds may perch or nest, but it is not a natural habitat for wild birds.<|end|>\nSo the correct choice is C: countryside.
