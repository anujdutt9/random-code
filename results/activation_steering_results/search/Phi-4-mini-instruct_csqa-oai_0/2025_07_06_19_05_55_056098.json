While some crabs can be found in freshwater or even terrestrial environments, the vast majority of crab species are marine.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA: maritime - This term refers to the sea or ocean, which is a broad category that includes saltwater environments where many crabs live. However, it is not specific enough to directly indicate the type of environment crabs live in.\n\nB: bodies of water - This is a very broad term that includes all types of water environments, such as oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, and even ponds. Crabs can be found in some of these environments, but this option is too general.\n\nC: saltwater - This is the most accurate and specific option. Crabs are predominantly marine creatures, meaning they live in saltwater environments.\n\nD: Galapagos - The Galapagos Islands are a specific location where certain species of crabs can be found. While this is true, it does not encompass the full range of environments where crabs live.\n\nE: fish market - This is a very specific and narrow environment where crabs might be found, but it does not describe the natural habitat of crabs.\n\nGiven the options, the best answer is:\n\nC: saltwater<|end|>\nSo the correct choice is C: saltwater.
