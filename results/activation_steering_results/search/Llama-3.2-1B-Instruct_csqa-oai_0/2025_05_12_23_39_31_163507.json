Virgilio Gonzalez\n2. Bernard Barker\n3. Frank Sturgis\n4. Eugenio Mart\u00ednez\n5. James McCord\n\nThese men were connected to CREEP and were tasked with installing wiretaps and gathering information on the Democratic Party. They were also involved in other activities, including the sale of secret documents to the Nixon administration.\n\nThe men involved in the break-in were questioned by authorities, and they were eventually caught and convicted of their roles in the scandal.
