When police officers are obstructing justice, they may use force to interfere with a police investigation or to intimidate witnesses. If individuals are subjected to police brutality, they may experience physical harm, which can be described as an attack.\n\nD: Getting hurt is a general consequence of being subjected to police brutality. However, the question asks about the consequences of obstructing justice, which involves interfering with police investigations or proceedings.\n\nE: Rioting is a type of civil disorder that involves large-scale violence and unrest. Obstructing justice is not typically associated with rioting, which is a separate type of offense.\n\nConsidering the definition of obstructing justice and its potential consequences, the most appropriate answer is that obstructing justice can lead to individuals experiencing physical harm, which can be described as an attack.\nSo the correct choice is C",

High in electrical terms refers to a high current. \n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Later - This doesn't relate to the current. Later refers to time, which is not relevant to the current.\n\nB. Updated - This doesn't relate to the current. Updating something refers to making changes or modifications, which is not relevant to the current.\n\nC. Still - This is a strong candidate. If the current is high, it means the circuit is functioning, and the wires are carrying the current. If the wires have too much resistance, the current would be high.\n\nD. Resistance - Resistance refers to the opposition to the flow of current. If the wires have too much resistance, the current would be high. This option directly addresses the issue.\n\nE. Now - This option is vague. The current is a property of the circuit, not a property of the wires. The wires are a part of the circuit, and the current is a function of the circuit's design.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nTo understand the wires might have too much resistance, Jan should have noticed if the current was low. If the current is high, it indicates that the wires have too much resistance, which is a common issue in electrical circuits.\nSo the correct choice is D",

However, the man's fear of illness might not necessarily cause him to avoid visiting a doctor.\n\nConsidering the man's fear of illness, the most likely reason for him to avoid visiting friends who are sick is that he is likely to be a sick person himself. This would naturally cause him to avoid situations involving illness.\nSo the correct choice is A",

This can be seen in the body's physiological response to physical exertion, where the body's energy is expended through the process of working.\n\n2. **Emotional Energy**: Some people may prefer to release energy through emotional expression. This can manifest in various ways, such as through creative activities, emotional expression, or engaging in social interactions. When individuals release energy through emotional expression, they are often using their emotions to channel and manage their energy.\n\n3. **Engaging in Activities**: Engaging in activities that involve the body and mind, such as hobbies, hobbies, or other leisure activities, can be another way to release energy. When individuals participate in these activities, they often release energy through the process of engaging in the activity.\n\nConsidering these points, the question asks about releasing energy through work.

Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down the brain's functions. As a result, when you're intoxicated, you might experience impaired cognitive functions, including:\n\n1. Impaired speech: As you're getting drunk, your speech might become slurred due to the effects of alcohol on the brain's language processing centers. This is a common symptom of intoxication.\n2. Impaired thought and decision-making: Alcohol can affect the brain's ability to process information and make decisions. This might lead to confusion, disorientation, and difficulty understanding what's happening around you.\n3. Memory and cognitive impairment: As the effects of alcohol take hold, you might experience memory and cognitive impairments, including difficulty concentrating, making decisions, and understanding conversations.\n\nConsidering these effects, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. A seizure: While alcohol can cause seizures, this is not typically associated with impaired speech and understanding.\nB. Slurred speech: As mentioned, impaired speech is a common symptom of intoxication, which aligns with the effects of alcohol on the brain.\nC. Death: Intoxication can lead to various health issues, but death is not a direct consequence of impaired speech and understanding.\nD. Forgetfulness: While intoxication can impair cognitive functions, forgetfulness is not a primary symptom of getting drunk.\nE. Pass out: Pass out, or fainting, is a possible consequence of intoxication, but impaired speech is a more specific symptom.\n\nGiven the effects of alcohol on the brain and body, impaired speech is a likely symptom when getting drunk. To better understand the situation, consider the context of the question. If you're getting drunk and people can't understand you, it's possible that you're experiencing impaired speech due to the effects of alcohol.\nSo the correct choice is B",

This condition can make playing tennis uncomfortable and painful. If someone is experiencing tennis elbow, it's likely that they would want to avoid the condition rather than continue playing.\n\nC: Exercise is a fundamental aspect of tennis, as it is a sport that requires physical movement and endurance. Engaging in regular exercise can improve overall health, increase energy levels, and enhance the enjoyment of playing tennis.\n\nA: Becoming tired is a natural aspect of playing tennis, as the game demands physical effort. However, if someone is experiencing fatigue while playing tennis, it may indicate that they need to reassess their playing style or take regular breaks to rest and recover.\n\nD: Hunger is not directly related to playing tennis. While maintaining physical health is essential for tennis, hunger is not a primary motivator for playing tennis.\n\nE: Victory is a significant aspect of playing tennis, as winning matches and tournaments can be a source of satisfaction and enjoyment. However, if someone is experiencing frustration or disappointment while playing tennis, it may lead to a desire to continue playing despite the challenges.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely option to encourage someone to continue playing tennis is becoming tired, as it is a natural aspect of the game that can motivate players to improve their performance and maintain their physical health.\nSo the correct choice is option A.<|eot_id|>",

Murder is a human act, and the consequences of committing murder are not directly related to the search for spiritual enlightenment.\n\nD. Guilty conscience: Committing murder can lead to feelings of guilt, remorse, and a sense of responsibility for the harm caused. A guilty conscience is a natural response to the act of committing murder, as the individual is aware of the harm they have caused.\n\nE.
