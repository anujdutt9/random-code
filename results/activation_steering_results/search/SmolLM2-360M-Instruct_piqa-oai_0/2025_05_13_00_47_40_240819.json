However, it's not a guarantee that they will be fully cured and achieve maximum strength.\n\nThe key point to remember is that liquid nails are applied to a surface, and they will dry and cure as soon as they come into contact with the surface. The drying time can vary depending on factors such as the surface material, humidity, temperature, and the type of adhesive used.\n\nIt's also important to note that liquid nails are not meant to be applied to surfaces that are excessively humid or have a high surface temperature. Over-application or prolonged exposure to humid or warm conditions can lead to a variety of problems, including warping, cracking, or even damage to the surface.\n\nIn summary, while liquid nails may look dry on the surface, it's essential to allow them to dry completely before applying them to a surface.
