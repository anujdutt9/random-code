            "response": "Smoke the bees. Once they are calm, remove the frames that are completely filled with honey from the hive.\n\nTo harvest honey from a bee box, the process is quite straightforward. The key is to ensure the bees are calm and the hive is in a state where they can easily access the honey.\n\nTo start, you'll want to carefully remove the frames from the hive. This can be done by using a hive tool or a specialized tool designed for this purpose. It's essential to handle the frames gently to avoid damaging the bees or the hive.\n\nOnce the frames are removed, you'll need to carefully remove the waxy cap from each comb. This cap is made of a waxy substance that helps to seal the comb and prevent the bees from crawling inside.\n\nTo remove the wax cap, you'll need a sharp knife. A sharp knife is essential for this process, as it's crucial to avoid damaging the bees or the comb.\n\nAfter removing the wax cap, the comb is ready to be drained. The comb is typically made up of a series of waxy layers that are stacked on top of each other.\n\nTo drain the honey from the comb, you'll need to use an extractor. An extractor is a device that uses centrifugal force to separate the honey from the waxy comb.\n\nTo use an extractor, you'll need to carefully place the comb frames over a bucket. The extractor will then spin rapidly, using centrifugal force to separate the honey from the wax.\n\nOnce the honey is drained from the comb, you can place the frames over a bucket and let the honey drain into the bucket over a period of time.\n\nThe process of harvesting honey from a bee box is relatively simple, and with proper care and attention, it's possible to harvest honey from a bee hive. By following the steps outlined above, you can successfully harvest honey from a bee box.\nSo the correct choice is B",

Cream is typically made from ingredients that are rich in fatty acids, vitamins, and other nutrients that help to lock in moisture and promote healthy skin.\n\nWhen using cream, it's important to apply it in a gentle manner to avoid rubbing it into the skin, which can cause irritation and dryness. The most common type of cream is a moisturizing cream, which is designed to help lock in moisture and prevent dryness.\n\nTo apply cream, you'll typically use a gentle, spreadable applicator, such as a pump or a brush. It's recommended to apply a small amount of cream to the areas where you'd like to apply it, and to apply it in a thin layer, using a gentle motion.\n\nWhen applying cream, it's a good idea to apply it in a circular motion, starting from the center of the skin and working outward in a smooth, sweeping motion. This helps to distribute the cream evenly and prevents any lumps or bumps from forming.\n\nOnce you've applied the cream, you can use a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt, oil, or other residue that may be on your skin. After removing the cleanser, you can apply a moisturizing cream to the affected areas, and then apply a gentle moisturizer to help lock in the moisture.\n\nThe key to using cream effectively is to apply it in a gentle manner, and to avoid rubbing it into the skin.
