James is thinking about a computer program, so he would likely be concerned with a manual, which is a non-digital, non-computer-based approach to understanding criminal justice.

This idea is in line with James' perspective, so he would probably not have a problem with the concept of processing information (B).\n\n3. Powering down a computer program means shutting it down. James views criminal justice as a program that needs to function correctly, so he would likely be concerned with maintaining the system rather than shutting it down.
